  The <kbd>composeb</kbd> axiom splits the safety of a sequential composition <code>a;b</code>, which runs <code>a</code> followed by <code>b</code>, into successive safety properties <code>[a][b]P</code> showing that after all runs of <code>a</code> it is the case that all runs of <code>b</code> are safe, so satisfy <code>P</code>.

    <li><kbd>MR</kbd> monotonicity tactic instead proves an intermediate condition that always holds after <code>a</code> and is strong enough to imply the safety of <code>b</code>.
      Using the monotonicity principle can better separate the proof but requires an intermediate condition transporting all required knowledge through <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>.</li>
    <li><kbd>chase</kbd> tactic equivalently chases formulas away by reducing them to structurally simpler formulas. Chase a formula way using Alt-Click or Option-Click.</li>
