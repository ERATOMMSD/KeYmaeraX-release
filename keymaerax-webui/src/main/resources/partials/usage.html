                        resolution, you can find the proof obligation of the selected agenda item. Hover the mouse over formulas in
                        the proof obligation to see your options for proof search locally at that formula.
                        Step (<span class="fa fa-step-forward"></span> Step) performs a single proof step based on the top-level operator in that formula.
                        Hide (<span class="fa fa-eye-slash"></span> Hide) performs weakening, which means it removes the formula from the proof obligation.

                        Instead of automated proof search, you can manually interact with the prover by clicking an operator in a
                        formula (e.g., the conjunction symbol), which picks a simplifying step based on the top-level operator in the formula.

                        proof search tactics like Auto and Normalize, which performs many of the same steps as Auto, but
                        does not attempt expensive operations such as solving differential equations.

        The page "Your Proofs" lists the available proofs and allows you to load and reprove. While reproving, a
        spinning wheel indicates that the prover is busy. When reproving finished, the spinning wheel changes into
        a button that lets you open the proof.

        The proof view indicates your tasks in a proof agenda. Right of or below the agenda, depending on your screen

            To let KeYmaera search for a proof fully automated, hover the mouse over the turnstile symbol. This will
            show automated tactics to handle all kinds of formulas, only propositional tactics, or tactics to handle
            arithmetic.

            Instead of automated proof search, you can manually interact with the prover by clicking an operator in a
            formula (e.g., the implication symbol). This opens a popup dialog that displays the applicable tactics.
            Click a tactic button to execute that tactic.
